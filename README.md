Oingo is a product wherein users can save notes based on location and the range for a particular group/set of friends. If anyone from this particular group/set of friends come in the specified range, they get notifications. Users can however set a filter for the type of notifications they want to see.Users can also comment on the notes if the admin of the notes has given access.Users can also make friends based on their current location(seems like a mixture of Facebook and Tinder)
